The aim of this project is to use numerical simulations to model the hydrostatic equilibrium of the gas (Part 1) and the evolution of iron abundance (Part 2). The numerical simulations were conducted using a Fortran90-based code, and the plots were generated with Gnuplot. The python codes are used to make qualitative just plots.
